### How to Run the Game
You can try running the ChristopherW application file, if it does not work you'll have to build it yourself. This can be done by opening the _.uproject_ file using _Unreal Engine 5.0.3_, and playing the game in the editor. Or, building the game based off your currently used operating system.

### Submission Note
I emailed the TA's and professor on October 30th about the lack of contribution from my teammate, who has still not contacted me. I have linked the zip file which contains all of the necessary project artifacts to run the game. The professor stated that I must complete a third level, but as I did not take account for the fact that my teammate would do zero work, I was not able to work on this part of the assignment quickly enough. I hope, besides that, you'll find my submission satisfactory. If not, please let me know what I did wrong.
